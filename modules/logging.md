# Logging

This will cover all commands in the Logging Module.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Most of these commands will require the **Manage Channels** permission.
{% endhint %}

| **Command** | **Usage** |
| :--- | :--- |
| ?setchannel &lt;channel&gt; &lt;all\|event&gt; | Sets the channel for which the events will be logged. You can choose all events to be logged, or a [certain event](../event-names.md). |
| ?enable &lt;all\|event&gt; | Enables a certain event, or all of them to be logged. **You must have a channel set** **first.** |
| ?disable &lt;all\|event&gt; | Disables an event. Events are **automatically disabled** by default. |
