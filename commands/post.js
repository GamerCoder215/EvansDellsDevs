This is a support server after all (Well, maybe not entirely), but still, just treat people how you want to be treated.\n\n2.) ‚ÜîÔ∏è **Be Specific**\nWhen asking a question or needing help, please be specific on what happened. What steps did you take to get to this? What module were you using? What arguments did you use?\n\n3.) <:angryping:764403014021808166> **Keep your name mentionable**\nIn case you\'re in need of support, make sure your name is mentionable. Names like \'≈ì¬Æ‚Ä†¬•\' and \'œÄ√∏≈ì‚àë\' can't be easily mentioned. If you don\'t want to change your name, make a nickname instead.\n\n4.)üîû **No NSFW Allowed**\nPlease, no NSFW content or images are permitted in this server. We take this rule very seriously, and anyone caught breaking it will be banned on the spot. We do __not__ tolerate this well and there is really no reason why you should be doing this.\n\n5.)‚ùì **Ask questions and have fun.**\nIf you\'ve passed all of the other rules, then please just be a human and ask questions. Nothing wrong with asking about a rule in <#764405930661117982> or just trying to level up in <#761572015236186143>. All we ask in return is to just use the bot and have fun.`)
