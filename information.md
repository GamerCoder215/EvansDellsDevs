## How to Change the Bot's Prefix

Sure, you may have multiple bots that have functions Connor doesn't have. But, you're going to need a different prefix, right? Simple:

{% hint style="info" %}
Only do this if you need to. Connor's default prefix is "**?"**
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need the **Manage Server** Permission to Run this Command.
{% endhint %}

**Some Examples**:

?prefix !

—&gt; !prefix $

—&gt; $prefix &

{% hint style="success" %}
This will change your prefix to **!**, **$, or &.**
{% endhint %}



## How to Search something on the Urban Dictionary

{% hint style="info" %}
This Command uses the **Urban Dictionary API**. If you need a way on how to do this for your own bot, look at the **Discord.JS Guide.**  
[https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/rest-api.html\#urban-dictionary](https://discordjs.guide/additional-info/rest-api.html#urban-dictionary)

If you aren't using the Discord.JS Library, consider searching google. 
{% endhint %}

Some computers can only support one app at once, and some people are just too lazy to open a new tab. Need a definition? Connor has you covered.

**?urban** &lt;keyword&gt;  
  
**Examples**:  
• ?urban hello world  
• ?urban dancing  
• ?urban discord

![In-App Example](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-22-at-12.52.40-pm.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
As you can see, I searched for **Hello World**, which is a commonly used starter program to test if apps or languages are working.
