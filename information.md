## How to Change the Bot's Prefix

Sure, you may have multiple bots that have functions Connor doesn't have. But, you're going to need a different prefix, right? Simple:

{% hint style="warning" %}
You need the **Manage Server** Permission to Run this Command.
{% endhint %}

**Some Examples**:

?prefix !

—&gt; !prefix $

—&gt; $prefix &

![In-App Example](.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-10-22-at-12.55.05-pm.png)

{% hint style="success" %}
This will change your prefix to **!**, **$, or &.**
{% endhint %}
